# CI/CD Project

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the building, testing, deploying, and monitoring process for a Kubernetes application using Docker, ArgoCD, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services. <br />
This pipeline gives developers the option to deploy their app with a simple push.

üõ†Ô∏è **Build**: The workflow starts with building a Docker image of the application, and pushing it to Docker Hub.

‚úÖ **Test**: After building, the application is deployed to a test cluster that create with terraform, by using k8s.

üåê **Deploy**: After successful testing, the application is deployed to a production cluster using ArgoCD.

üìà **Monitor**: Finally, the monitoring components (Prometheus and Grafana) are installed on the production cluster.
